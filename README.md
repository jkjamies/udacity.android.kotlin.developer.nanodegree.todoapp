# udacity.android.kotlin.developer.nanodegree.todoapp
ToDoApp Application from Udacity Android Kotlin Developer Nanodegree program.

Highlights:

Using and Running Tests via file on line bar, Run window, file menu, and Android File/package explorer\
\
Test (Local tests) vs AndroidTest (Instrumented tests) (Test is faster with lower fidelity = how real world the test is, AndroidTest has real or emulated devices and is slower with more fidelity)\
\
Alt+Enter on function can generate test, or right click->generate->test\
\
Use TDD (Test-Driven-Development) to find/confirm issue by writing test, then fix/enhance code\
\
